My objective is to revamp the experience descriptions on my resume to emphasize my achievements and deliverables rather than just the tasks I've performed.\n\n# CONTEXT\nCurrently, my resume leans more towards portraying me as a \"doer\" rather than an \"achiever.\" The focus is too much on tasks rather than measurable results and the impact I've made in my roles. I want to change this perception.\n\n# PROCESS\nIt is important that the process is thorough, and does not leave out any item behind in any of the steps defined:\n1. Request the current experience Description Items from me, including the name of the company, job position, and the dates during which I worked at the company.\n2. Review all items, and generate a CLEANSED SET of Description Items which will avoid redundancies while retaining all essential information included on the original input of Description Items.\n3. Based on the Items cleansed on step #2, generate an OPTIMIZED SET, which will consist of the optimization of each Cleansed experience description based on the OPTIMIZATION CRITERIA outlined below. \n\n# OPTIMIZATION CRITERIA\n- The goal is to make the hiring manager visualize how I can replicate or even exceed my past successes at their organization.\n- Highlight my achievements and the impact I've made, phrased in a way that resonates with what the hiring manager is looking for in a candidate.\n- Replace passive phrases and non-action verbs with dynamic action verbs and engaging language that brings my experience to life.\n- Avoid fabricating numerical or statistical information. The Summarized and Optimized items should only contain data that is either explicitly stated or can be reasonably inferred from the original description items. In other words, it's okay to draw logical conclusions that add value to the description, but don't introduce numbers or stats that can't be supported.\n- Include quantifiable metrics to provide concrete evidence of achievements. Use percentages, dollar amounts, or other numerical values where appropriate.\n- Highlight skill sets developed or utilized in each role, connecting them with the accomplishments achieved.\n- Tailor language to fit the specific industry or role, using industry-appropriate jargon or terminology, if it enhances the description.\n\n## EXAMPLES\nHere are some examples of task-based items, which are then Optimized based on the OPTIMIZATION CRITERIA defined:\n### EXAMPLE A\n- Not Optimized: Passive/Doing: \"Marketing strategies for B2C, B2B, and Amazon channels through resilient technological architectures to achieve business goals.\"\n- Optimized: Active/Achieving: \"Elevated sales by architecting and implementing innovative B2C, B2B, and Amazon marketing strategies that are highly resilient and scalable.\"\n### EXAMPLE B\n- Not Optimized: Passive/Doing: \"Led platform selection and migration projects; design, and architecture documentation: Ecommerce, Customer Data Platform, Email Service Platform, CRM, Feed Mgmt.\"\n- Optimized: Active/Achieving: \"Streamlined operational efficiency by spearheading the selection and migration of mission-critical platforms, including Ecommerce, Customer Data Platform, Email Service, and CRM. Authored comprehensive design and architecture documentation, thereby enhancing project transparency and stakeholder buy-in.\"\n### EXAMPLE C\n- Not Optimized: Passive/Doing: \"Negotiated contracts with vendors.\"\n- Optimized: Active/Achieving: \"Slashed payroll/benefits administration costs through skillful negotiation of vendor contracts, while enhancing service quality.\"\n\n# OUTPUT FORMAT\n- Do not include the CLEANSED SET, only include in output the OPTIMIZED SET of items as a bullet list.\n\n# ADDITIONAL NOTES\n- Aim for a positive and enthusiastic tone throughout the experience descriptions.\n- Think step by step.\n"
