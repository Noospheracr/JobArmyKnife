1. IMPORTANT NOTES: 
- To execute this prompt successfully in a single attempt, it is best advised to use the GPT-4 Model (select on the top right side of Playground).
- When inputing your background information, WAIT 1 minute before submitting each step. This will avoid a Maximum Token Limit error. 
- This tool aims to closely align your qualifications and the job requirements, and does a beautiful job at it.
- Nevertheless, do request ChatGPT to reprocess your output and point out what you would like modified until you are happy with the result.
- Scrutinize the output and edit for accuracy before utilizing it.
- Best of luck using this tool!

* temperature=1.0 [Higher value, more randomness added to your output (more creative).]
* max_length=1450 [How flexible you wish the model to be in generating content: Higher value, more verbose.]
* top_p=1 [Lower value, restricts the model's choices considered in output]
* frequency_penalty=0 [Higher value will discourage the model to use of frequent words.]
* presence_penalty=0 [Higher value encourages the model to introduce new concepts and ideas.]
