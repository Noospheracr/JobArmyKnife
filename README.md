# JobArmyKnife
A set of AI-based tools (mainly interacting with ChatGPT-4) which will help you polish up your resume and cover letter when in the process of looking for a job. 

~~ MOTIVATION ~~
* I created these tools while taking a Prompting for AI Ops certification program from The AI Exchange [https://courses.theaiexchange.com/courses/prompting-for-ai-ops-bootcamp?ref=afe18c].
* I wanted to apply my learnings on something that could help me at least find a job. 
* I hope these tools contribute to your landing a job soon as well! 

~~ GOAL ~~
* The free tools you find here are meant to optimize your resume or cover letter, not to overtake the task of creating these key "Army Knifes" in your job searching process.  

~~ ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THESE TOOLS ~~                                                                                 
1. Everyone has experience doing something, the problem is that not everyone knows how to express that correctly on their resume or cover letter.
2. Hence, these tools will always try to make the most out of whatever you have achieved in your lifetime so far.
   
~~ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING THESE TOOLS ~~
A. Copy/paste your resume in a TXT document, and clean and organize it using a standarized markdown (here's a great cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
B. When using the "Cover Letter Draft Generator", do the same for the description of the job you are applying to.
